## Content Specific Email Tips & Tricks

### Onboarding

- Provide tips to help users get started.
- Showcase only the most essential features - too much information can be overwhelming and potentially confusing if the user is still unfamiliar with your app.
- Provide links to your documentation and let users know how they can get support.
- For more tips, check out our page on [User Onboarding][25].
- Try to always send a welcome email after a user signs up. Below is an example from LivingSocial that contains simple but clear calls to action and lets users know about a deal:

### Sale and Promotional

- Within seconds of opening your email, users should know the value of the promotion (what the discounts are and what is on sale) and how long the offer lasts.
- Provide graphics to illustrate any products that you're promoting.
- Keep your copy concise and simple so that it doesn't clutter your email and distract users from the essential content.
- Make your call to action clear and give recipients an easy way to immediately participate in the promotion.
- If you're recommending certain products, try to present them as curated, personal suggestions that the user may like.
- Use social proof to promote your products. Show users any items their friends have liked or purchased.
- If you're promoting a limited time offer, be sure to let users know! Ideeli does a great job at conveying urgency in this email:

### Transactional
- If the user just made an in-app purchase, you should thank them and provide any tips that can help them make the most of that purchase.
- If the user just made an out-of-app purchase, provide them with shipping confirmation and a way to ask questions about their shipment.
- Asking users to give feedback after a purchase is a good way to solicit input without being pushy. Because you've just provided users with a service, they may be more likely to share their thoughts. Here's an example of an email from Restaurant.com:

![Restaurant email][28]

### Retention

- Keep your tone friendly.
- This may be your last chance to win users back, so be sure to include content that showcases your app's value.
- If the user has been relatively inactive since installing, offer helpful hints for getting started.
- For social apps, keep users updated on their friends' activities.
- Offer discounts or any other incentives that may bring users back.
- Try to make your message personal to show the user that he is still valued. Rue La La, for instance, frames its retention email as a note from its CEO:

![Ruelala email][29]

### Social

- Email can help you build up a social fanbase by directing recipients toward your Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Pinterest, Youtube channel, etc.
- Include links to your social media accounts within the email to make it easy for users to connect.
- Make it fun! Try running a photo contest, promoting a hashtag, or having a giveaway. Below is an email from Hailo that offers a reward for participating in photo challenges:

![Hailo social email][30]

### Updates

- Send updates of new or improved features to all of your users.
- Updating users on new features is also a re-engagement tool because it reminds lapsing users of your app's value.
- If your feature requires an explanation or demo, include a link in the message. Here's an example by Allrecipes.com:
