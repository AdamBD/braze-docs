# Universal (Apps & Browsers)

## Full-Screen
These are the most engaging, but also the most intrusive since they cover your user’s entire screen. They are great for displaying large, rich images, and can be useful in conveying very important information, such as crucial new features and expiring promotions. Since they are more disruptive of the user experience, use these sparingly for top priority content.

### Customizable Features

- Header and body text
- A large image
- Up to two call to action buttons with separate on click behavior and deep links
- Different colors for the header and body text, buttons and background
- Key-value pairs

## Modal
These messages aren’t as intrusive as full-screen messages, as they still allow users to see part of your app’s UI. Since they still contain buttons and images, modal messages may be a better option than slideups if you desire a more interactive, visual campaign. These are great for medium priority content, such as app updates and non-urgent deals and events.

### Customizable Features

- Header and body text
- An image or customizable badge icon
- Up to two call to action buttons with separate on click behavior and deep links
- Different colors for the header and body text, buttons and background
- Key-value pairs

## Traditional Slideup
These are the least intrusive message type, though they can be more or less attention-grabbing depending on your usage of colors and badge icons. This may be the message format to use when onboarding new users and directing them towards particular in-app features, as they don’t pause the app experience and allow for continuous exploration.
