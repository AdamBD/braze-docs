# January 2020

Welcome to a New Year and New Decade! 

## Custom Attribute Filter Behavior
The Dashboard has improved filters that include more intuitive behaviors.
There have been two significant changes to how certain custom attributes filters work. 
The custom attribute filter changes are reflected in the filters: 
- Less than __X__ Days Ago
- Less than __X__ Days in the Future
- Day of Custom Attribute
__If you use these filters in your segmentation, we recommend readjusting your segments to take these changes into account.__ 

Check out our [documentation]({{ site.baseurl }}/user_guide/data_and_analytics/custom_data/custom_attributes/#dates) for an explanation of the new behaviors.

## Added SMS Capability

Braze now allows you to [cap the frequency](/docs/user_guide/engagement_tools/campaigns/testing_and_more/rate-limiting/) of SMS messages as well as implement an added [segment filter](/docs/user_guide/engagement_tools/segments/segmentation_filters/) "Last Received SMS".

In the SMS channel, the New User settings and behavior have been outlined and can be checked out [here](/docs/user_guide/message_building_by_channel/sms/keywords/).
