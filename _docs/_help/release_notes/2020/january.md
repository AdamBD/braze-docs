# January 2019

Welcome to a New Year and New Decade! 

## Custom Attribute Filter Behavior

The Dashboard has improved filters that include more intuitive behaviors.
There have been two significant changes to how certain custom attributes filters work. 

The custom attribute filter changes are reflected in the filters: 
- Less than __X__ Days Ago
- Less than __X__ Days in the Future
- Day of Custom Attribute

__If you use these filters in your segmentation, we recommend readjusting your segments to take these changes into account.__ <br>
Check out our [documentation]({{ site.baseurl }}/user_guide/data_and_analytics/custom_data/custom_attributes/#dates) for an explanation of the new behaviors.
