## iOS 14 Upgrade Guide 
In accordance with the changes announced in Apple’s new iOS 14, there are some Braze-related changes and action items required for Braze iOS SDK integrations. For more information, take a look at [this upgrade guide](https://www.braze.com/docs/developer_guide/platform_integration_guides/ios/ios_14/).

## Changes to IDFA and IDFV for iOS 14
In iOS14, users must decide if they want to opt-in to ad tracking and let apps and ad networks read their IDFA when visiting an app. As a result, Braze’s strategy is to instead use the “identifier for vendors” (i.e. IDFA) so you can continue to track users across different devices. For more information, take a look at [this section in the iOS 14 upgrade guide](https://www.braze.com/docs/developer_guide/platform_integration_guides/ios/ios_14/#idfa).

## Email Validation
This new email syntax validation process is an upgrade to Braze’s existing one. This is a check to verify that emails updated or imported into braze are correct. For more information, take a look at [these guidelines and notes](https://www.braze.com/docs/user_guide/onboarding_with_braze/email_setup/email_validation).
