# Most Recent Braze Release Notes

_Braze releases information on itâ€™s product updates on a monthly cadence. For more information on any of the updates listed in this section, reach out to your account manager or to [open a support ticket][support]._

## April 2019

### Subscription Groups Archiving

You can now [archive Subscription Groups]({{ site.baseurl}}/user_guide/message_building_by_channel/email/managing_user_subscriptions/#archiving-groups)! Archived Subscription Groups cannot be edited and will no longer appear in Segment Filters.  If you attempt to archive a group which is being used as a Segment Filter in any email, campaign, or canvas, you will receive an error message that will prevent you from archiving the Group until you remove all usages of it.

More updates to come for April! Come back again in a few weeks!

## March 2019

### In-App Messages - Generation 3

Braze is proud to announce that we have made improvements to the look and feel of our in-app messages to adhere to the latest UX and UI best practices. In the newest in-app messages, you can expect your users to interact with messages with
- larger font sizes,
- refined spacing,
- a new close `x` asset,
- improved responsive behavior for all message types to better fit viewports of all sizes, and
- button borders to help you create custom contrasts between buttons.

Our [new in-app messages]({{ site.baseurl }}/user_guide/message_building_by_channel/in-app_messages/overview/) will take your interactions with your user from good to app-mazing!

#### What You Need to Do

We highly recommend updating to the latest versions of the Braze SDKs for [Web]({{ site.baseurl }}/developer_guide/platform_integration_guides/web/initial_sdk_setup/#upgrading-the-sdk), [iOS]({{ site.baseurl }}/developer_guide/platform_integration_guides/ios/initial_sdk_setup/initial_sdk_setup/), and [Android]({{ site.baseurl }}/developer_guide/platform_integration_guides/android/initial_sdk_setup/android_sdk_integration/).

After that, you're good to go!

## February 2019

### Email Subscription Groups

[Subscription Groups]({{ site.baseurl }}/user_guide/message_building_by_channel/email/managing_user_subscriptions/#subscription-groups) are segment filters that can further narrow your audience from the [Global Subscription States]({{ site.baseurl }}/user_guide/message_building_by_channel/email/managing_user_subscriptions/) above. These Groups offer the ability to present more granular subscription options to end users.

For example, if you send out multiple categories of email campaigns, you can offer your customers the option to subscribe or unsubscribe from those groups in bulk from a single page, using our [Email Preference Center](#email-preference-center).

Use the [Subscription Group REST APIs]({{ site.baseurl }}/developer_guide/rest_api/subscription_group_api/) to programmatically manage the subscription groups that you have stored on the Braze dashboard to the Subscription Group page.

### Email Preference Center

The [Email Preference Center]({{ site.baseurl }}/user_guide/message_building_by_channel/email/managing_user_subscriptions/#email-preference-center) is an easy way to manage which users receive certain groups of newsletters. Each Subscription Group you create is added to the Preference Center list. Click on the name of the Preference Center to see an interactive preview.
