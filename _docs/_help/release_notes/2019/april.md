# April 2019

## Subscription Groups Archiving

You can now [archive Subscription Groups]({{ site.baseurl}}/user_guide/message_building_by_channel/email/managing_user_subscriptions/#archiving-groups)! Archived Subscription Groups cannot be edited and will no longer appear in Segment Filters.  If you attempt to archive a group which is being used as a Segment Filter in any email, campaign, or canvas, you will receive an error message that will prevent you from archiving the Group until you remove all usages of it.

More updates to come for April! Come back again in a few weeks!
