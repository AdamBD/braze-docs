## SMS

Check out our [Set Up Guide]({{ site.baseurl }}/user_guide/onboarding_with_braze/sms_setup/) to get started and our [SMS Sending Guide]({{ site.baseurl }}/user_guide/message_building_by_channel/sms/) to learn more!

## Content Block Improvements

The API ID for a Content Block will now show on the selected Content Block page in the dashboard. Additionally, we will display where Content Blocks are being used.

## Alias-only User creation and Identification via the API

You can now [use an API request]({{ site.baseurl }}/api/endpoints/user_data/#user-attributes-object-specification) with any fields in the Attributes Object will create or update an attribute of that name with the given value on the specified user profile.
