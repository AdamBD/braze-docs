# AppsFlyer

{% include video.html id="gQ9y2DA2LuQ" align="right" %}

> AppsFlyer is a mobile marketing analytics and attribution platform that helps you analyze and optimize your apps through marketing analytics, mobile attribution, and deep linking.

Build more holistic marketing campaigns by leveraging mobile install attribution data from AppsFlyer. With AppsFlyer and Braze, you can pass install attribution data to Braze to better understand how to optimize your campaigns.

## Integration

### Step 1: Integration Requirements

{% alert important %}
As of March 4th, 2019, AppsFlyer requires that the Activate Partner toggle be switched to "on" for every integrated partner, including Braze. Please be sure that your toggle is flipped on from your AppsFlyer dashboard.
{% endalert %}

* This integration supports iOS and Android apps.
* Your app will need Braze's SDK and AppsFlyer's SDK installed.

{% tabs local %}
{% tab Android %}

If you have an Android app, you will need to include the code snippet below, which passes a unique Braze device id to AppsFlyer. For most setups, this code should be included alongside all calls to `AppsFlyerLib.setAppsFlyerKey`, typically in an activity's `onCreate` callback.

```java
HashMap<String, Object> customData = new HashMap<String,Object>();
String deviceId = Appboy.getInstance(context).getInstallTrackingId();
customData.put("customData", deviceId);
AppsFlyerLib.setAdditionalData(customData);
```
{% endtab %}
{% tab iOS %}

If you have an iOS app, the Braze SDK requires that you have [IDFA collection]({{site.baseurl}}/developer_guide/platform_integration_guides/ios/initial_sdk_setup/optional_idfa_collection/#optional-idfa-collection) enabled. 

{% endtab %}
{% tab Unity %}

```
CopiedAppboy.AppboyBinding.GetInstallTrackingId()
Dictionary<string, string> customData = new Dictionary<string, string>();
customData.Add("brazeCustomerId", Appboy.AppboyBinding.GetInstallTrackingId());
AppsFlyer.setAdditionalData(customData);
```

{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

### Step 2: Getting the Braze API Key

In your Braze account, navigate to "Technology Partners" , then "Attribution" and find the API key and REST Endpoint in the AppsFlyer section. The API key and the REST Endpoint are used in the next step when setting up a postback in AppsFlyer's dashboard.

### Step 3: Configure Braze in AppsFlyer's Dashboard

In AppsFlyer's dashboard, navigate to the "Integrated Partners" page on the left bar. From here, search for Braze and click on Braze's logo to open up a configuration window.
![AppsFlyer][1]{: style="float:right;max-width:30%;margin-left:15px;margin-bottom:15px;margin-top:15px"}

Within the Integration tab, switch on Activate Partner, copy the Braze API key into the "API_key" field, add the Braze REST Endpoint URL into the "REST Endpoint" field. Finally, save your configuration.

Additional information on these instructions is available in [AppsFlyer's documentation][16].

Once you have saved the configuration, AppsFlyer sends the following data to Braze for every organic and non-organic install. Below, you can view how Braze maps AppsFlyer's data fields to specific segment filters.

| AppsFlyer Data Field | Braze Segment Filter |
| -------------------- | --------------------- |
| `media_source` | Attributed Source |
| `campaign` | Attributed Campaign |
| `af_adset` | Attributed Adgroup |
| `af_ad` | Attributed Ad |

### Step 4: Confirming the Integration

Once Braze receives attribution data from AppsFlyer, the status connection indicator on "Technology Partners" , then "Attribution" will change to green and a timestamp of the last successful request will be included. Note that this will not happen until we receive data about an __attributed__ install. Organic installs, which should be excluded by the AppsFlyer integration, are ignored by our API and are not counted when determining if a successful connection was established.

### Step 5: Viewing User Attribution Data

Your user-base can be segmented by attribution data in the Braze dashboard using the Install Attribution filters.

![User Attributes 1][2]{: style="max-width:80%;margin-right:15px;"} 

Additionally, attribution data for a particular user is available on each userâ€™s profile in the Braze dashboard.

## Facebook, Snapchat, and Twitter Attribution Data

Attribution data for Facebook, Snapchat, and Twitter campaigns is __not available through our partners__. These media sources do not permit their partners to share attribution data with third-parties and, therefore, our partners __cannot send that data to Braze__.

For more information, please see AppsFlyer's [documentation][31].

## Universal Linking and Click Tracking

Click tracking/recording is a crucial part of getting accurate user data. Oftentimes, when click tracking is used in tandem with universal linking, the universal link is prone to breaking. This is caused by Email Service Providers wrapping the deep link in their own click recording domain, causing the original link to break.
