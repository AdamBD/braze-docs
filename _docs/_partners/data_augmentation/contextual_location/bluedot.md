[Bluedot](https://bluedot.io/) is a location platform that provides an accurate and straightforward geofencing platform for apps.

You can use Bluedot’s SDK to message smarter, automate mobile order check-ins, optimize workflows, and create frictionless experiences. Combine the power of Braze with the precision and scalability of Bluedot’s location services to accelerate growth, drive loyalty engagement and revenue in your app and beyond.

Events (entry/exit) generated by the user on their device is sent immediately to Braze along with all relevant information. This information can be used to build journeys, campaigns or even analyze customers behavior and interests.


## Integration

The integration of the Bluedot Point SDK and the Braze SDK is simple and straight forward. Just follow the below steps to integrate the SDKs in your app:

**Step 1:** Create a Bluedot account and then set up a project to get started with the Braze integration. You can learn how to set up a Bluedot Project [here](https://docs.bluedot.io/canvas/the-new-canvas-ui/).

**Step 2:** Integrate the Bluedot Point SDK and the Braze SDK in your app using the steps provided in the [Bluedot-Braze Integration](https://docs.bluedot.io/braze-integration/) documentation.

**Step 3:** You need to use the `projectId` created in step 1 to authenticate the Bluedot Point SDK.


## Use Cases

The custom event information provided by Bluedot can be used in cases like `QSR` (Quick Service Restaurant), `Click and Collect`, `Drive-Thru` to start a campaign targeting these customers.
