## Integration Details

To enable this integration, first integrate the Braze and Neura SDKs on Android and iOS. To integrate the Neura SDK you simply add a few lines of code to your [AppDelegate on iOS][8] or [MainActivity class on Android][4]. You’ll then instantly begin receiving [Neura Moments™][3], on the device or to a webhook, as Braze custom events - even when your app isn’t running. You’ll also gain the ability to segment users based on their real-world lifestyles and habits, [True Personas™][2], and turn those into Braze user attributes.

In order to properly map the Braze and Neura SDKs, you will need to set the `external_id` chosen by you as the `external_id` inside Neura’s SDK. Neura will add a user alias with Neura’s id to bind between the ids.

Next, find your App ID on the Developer Console section of the Braze Dashboard and create a new API Key with `users.track` and `users.alias.new` permissions.

Enter your Braze REST API Key and (optionally) App IDs in the Neura Console (for each integrated mobile platform):

Once you have configured the Neura Console, the Neura API will automatically uncover engagement opportunities and forward them to Braze, allowing you to target and segment your customers. See the [Neura developer site][6] for more details, tutorials, and FAQs.

**Note that the Neura SDK requires that you enable location services.**

## Segmenting

A Neura [True Personas™][2] is an ML generated user profile that represents each user's real-world behavioral traits. Unlike web-based segments, which are remotely-inferred from the user's interest in web content, a [True Personas™][2] is directly coupled to each user's lifestyle, routine, and habits.

While web-based segments age from the moment they are generated, losing their value and relevancy over time, a [True Personas™][2] is dynamic, current, and built to serve today's always-on digital experiences.

You can use the Neura API to set each user’s [True Personas™][2] as a Custom Attribute on your Braze users’ User Profiles. You can then use the “matches regex” comparison to engage users who have a specific set of behavioral or personality traits in the real world: for example, segmenting all users who are avid runners, workaholics, business travelers, busy bees, etc.

You can even dive deeper and segment users by specific real-world behavioral metrics to leverage this data point for your precise targeting use cases by accessing [Behavioral Profiles][7] during your audience segmentation process.

## Messaging

Be there, when each user needs you. Set up a Campaign or Canvas in the Braze Dashboard that will take action based on real-world situations in each user’s life – [Neura Moments™][3] are engagement opportunities generated by the Neura API. This integration route is ideal for reaching each user with contextually-relevant messaging when they are in need of your service or receptive to an engagement attempt by your product.

![neura-moments_diagram.png][16]

For example, you can setup an Action-Based Campaign within Braze that sends messages when a user wakes up, finishes a run, is predicted to go to bed, or arrives to an airport. Create a Campaign (or a Canvas) in Braze and set it to send using Action-Based Delivery. For your trigger, use a Custom Event based on a [Neura Moments™][3] as seen below:

Make each engagement attempt a welcome ones. Engage the relevant True Persona™ at the ideal Neura Moment™ to achieve optimal engagement and drive higher conversion rates.
