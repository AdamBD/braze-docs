# Snowflake

Summary of what Snowflake is and how we work together. Data-sharing!

## Use Cases
- Similar to Currents
- Complex File Reports
- Attribution modeling
- Mapping raw event or user data to a CRM like Salesforce

## Requirements

|Requirement | Description |
|---|---|
|Snowflake account & ID |
| Braze App Group ID |

## Integration

If you're interested in this integration, reach out to your Braze Account or Customer Success Manager and ask to consult the Braze Business Intelligence Team on data-sharing with Snowflake. This will get the cogs going inside Braze. It will involvce and update to your MSA.

### Manual Steps? 

Some code.

## Usage/Visualization

Braze will send you some views.

You'll have access to historical, current, and future data dating from the beginning of when data was sent to Snowflake up until you choose not to utilize Snowflake anymore.

You can do whatever you want with it, but we recommend using it in conjunction with our Looker Blocks.

### Data

The data you'll see in Snowflake is similar to what you'd see in currents.
