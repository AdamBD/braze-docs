# About Tealium

> Tealium is a universal data hub and customer data platform that enables you to connect mobile, web and alternative data to other third-party sources.

Tealiumâ€™s connection to Braze enables a data flow of custom events, user attributes, and purchases that empower you to act on your data in real-time.

We offer [both](#integration-options) a side-by-side SDK integration for your Android, iOS, and web applications and a server-to-server integration for your backend services so that you can start building richer user profiles.

## Set Up Overview

To get going with your Tealium/Braze integration,
1. Take note of and prepare for your integration by [adhering to the requirements and pre-requisites](#pre-requisites).
2. Set up [Braze as a Destination](#connection-settings) in accordance with [your chosen integration type](#integration-options).
3. If you're a new-to-Braze customer, you can relay historical data to Braze using [Segment Replays](#segment-replays).
4. Set up [mappings](#methods) for your integration.
5. [Test your integration](#step-3-test-your-integration) to ensure data is flowing smoothly between Braze and Segment.

## Pre-Requisites

## Tealium EventStream 
Tealium EventStream is a data collection and API hub that sits at the center of your data. EventStream handles the entire data supply chain from setup and installation, to identifying, validating, and enhancing incoming user data. EventStream takes real-time action with event feeds and connectors. Listed below are the features that make up the [EventStream](https://community.tealiumiq.com/t5/Customer-Data-Hub/Introduction-to-EventStream/ta-p/20387#toc-hId--2077371752).  
- Data Sources (Installation and Data Collection)
- Live Events] (Real-time Data Inspection)
- Event Specifications and Attributes (Data Layer Requirements and Validation)
- Event Feeds (Filtered Event Types)
- Event Connectors (API Hub Actions)

## Tealium AudienceStream
Tealium AudienceStream is an Omnichannel customer segmentation and real-time action engine. AudienceStream takes the data that flows into EventStream and creates visitor profiles that represent the most important attributes of your customers' engagement with your brand. These visitor profiles are segmented by shared behaviors to create audiences, sets of visitors with common traits. These audiences fuel your marketing technology stack in real-time via connectors. For more information on AudeinceStream, check out the Tealium Documentation [here](https://community.tealiumiq.com/t5/Customer-Data-Hub/Introduction-to-AudienceStream/ta-p/16087).

## Step 1: Configure Braze Settings in Tealium

## Step 2a: Choose Integration Type and Implement

### Side-by-Side SDK Integration

| Integration | Details |
| ----------- | ------- |
| [Side-by-Side](#side-by-side-sdk-integration) | Maps Segment's SDK to Braze's, allowing access to deeper features and a more comprehensive usage of Braze than the server-to-server integration. |
| [Server-to-Server](#server-to-server-integration) | Forwards data from Segment to Braze's [user/track endpoint]({{site.baseurl}}/api/endpoints/user_data?redirected=true#user-track-endpoint). |
{: .reset-td-br-1 .reset-td-br-2}

#### Remote Commands

Remote Commands is a feature of the Tealium iOS and Android libraries that allows native code to be triggered with the Tealium iQ Tag Management.

The Braze integration uses the native Braze SDK, a remote command module that wraps the Braze methods, and the Braze Remote Command tag that translates event tracking into native Braze calls. This solution leverages the convenience of Tag Management to configure a native Braze implementation without having to add vendor-specific code to your app.

- [Android](https://docs.tealium.com/platforms/remote-commands/integrations/braze/)
- [Web](https://community.tealiumiq.com/t5/Client-Side-Tags/Braze-Web-SDK-Tag-Setup-Guide/ta-p/20106)

### Server-to-Server Integration

This integration forwards data from Tealium to Braze's REST API. Similar to the side-by-side integration, you may need to map Tealium methods to Braze.

## Step 1: Configure Braze Settings in Tealium {#connection-settings}

Pre-Requisites

| Name | Description |

## Step 3: Test your Tealium Connector

After your connector is up and running, you should test it to make sure it's working properly. The most simple way to test this is to use a __Trace Tool__.

1. Start a new trace.
2. Examine the real-time log.
3. Check for the action you want to validate by clicking __Actions Triggered__ entry to expand.
4. Look for the action you want to validate and view the log status.
