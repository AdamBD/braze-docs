# About Tealium

> Tealium is a universal data hub that enables you to connect mobile, web, and alternative data to other third-party sources.

Tealiumâ€™s connection to Braze enables a data flow of custom events, user attributes, and purchases that empower you to act on your data in real-time.

We offer [both](#integration-options) a side-by-side SDK integration for your Android, iOS, and web applications and a server-to-server integration for your backend services so that you can start building richer user profiles.

## Set Up Overview

To get going with your Tealium/Braze integration,
1. Take note of and prepare for your integration by [adhering to the requirements and pre-requisites](#pre-requisites).
2. Set up [Braze as a Destination](#connection-settings) in accordance with [your chosen integration type](#integration-options).
3. If you're a new-to-Braze customer, you can relay historical data to Braze using [Segment Replays](#segment-replays).
4. Set up [mappings](#methods) for your integration.
5. [Test your integration](#step-3-test-your-integration) to ensure data is flowing smoothly between Braze and Segment.

## Pre-Requisites

| Requirement| Origin| Access| Description|
| ---| ---| ---|
| Tealium Account & Account Information | Tealium | https://my.tealiumiq.com/ | You must have an active Tealium Account to utilize their services with Braze. |
| Braze SDK Integration | Braze | For more details regarding Braze's SDKs, please refer to our [iOS][1], [Android][2] and [Web][3] documentation | Braze must successfully be installed onto your app or site |

## Side-by-Side SDK Integration


| Integration | Details |
| ----------- | ------- |
| [Side-by-Side / Device-mode](#side-by-side-sdk-integration) | Maps Segment's SDK to Braze's, allowing access to deeper features and a more comprehensive usage of Braze than the server-to-server integration. |
| [Server-to-Server / Cloud-mode](#server-to-server-integration) | Forwards data from Segment to Braze's [user/track endpoint]({{site.baseurl}}/api/endpoints/user_data?redirected=true#user-track-endpoint). |
{: .reset-td-br-1 .reset-td-br-2}


{% tabs %}
{% tab Android %}

See and set up [mappings](#methods) to Segment's SDK for [Android](https://github.com/appboy/appboy-segment-android) on Braze's Github.

To complete the side-by-side integration, please refer to Tealiums's detailed instructions for [Android](https://docs.tealium.com/platforms/remote-commands/integrations/braze/).

{% endtab %}
{% tab iOS %}

See and set up [mappings](#methods) to Segment's SDK for [iOS](https://github.com/appboy/appboy-segment-ios) on Braze's Github.

To complete the side-by-side integration, please refer to Tealiums's detailed instructions for [iOS](https://docs.tealium.com/platforms/remote-commands/integrations/braze/).

{% endtab %}
{% tab Web or Javascript %}

See and set up [mappings](#methods) to Segment's SDK for [Web / Analytics.js (Segment's JavaScript SDK)](https://github.com/segment-integrations/analytics.js-integration-appboy) on Braze's Github.

For Braze's Web SDK, [Segment's Analytics.js library](https://github.com/segment-integrations/analytics.js-integration-appboy) dynamically pulls in and initializes our Web SDK when you add Braze as a destination on your Segment dashboard. However, to use Braze's browser notification capabilities, please refer to Segment's [Web](https://community.tealiumiq.com/t5/Client-Side-Tags/Braze-Web-SDK-Tag-Setup-Guide/ta-p/20106) documentation.

{% endtab %}

{% alert important %}
For the side-by-side integration, inputting the "Braze REST API Key" into your [Braze's Connection Settings](#connection-settings) in the Segment Dashboard is **not** necessary.
{% endalert %}

## Server-to-Server Integration

This integration forwards data from Tealium to Braze's REST API. 

Similar to the side-by-side integration, you will need to map Segment [methods](#methods) to Braze.

Unlike the side-by-side integration, however, the server-to-server integration does **not** support any of Braze's UI features, such as in-app messaging, News Feed, or push notifications.

REST API Keys
API keys are used to authenticate an API call.
