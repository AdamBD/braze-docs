# Snowflake Secure Data Sharing

> Snowflake is a purpose-built SQL cloud data warehouse for all of your data and all of your users. With Snowflake's unique and patented architecture it's easy to amass all of your data, enable rapid analytics, and derive data-driven insights for all of your users.

Braze leverages Snowflakeâ€™s Data Exchange to build a presence, find new customers, and expand reach through the ever-growing Snowflake customer base.

Learn more about this partnership [here](https://www.braze.com/perspectives/article/snowflake-partner-announcement)!

### What is Data Sharing?

Data Sharing allows Braze to allow you secure access to data on our Snowflake portal without worrying about workflow friction or slowdown, failure points, and unnecessary costs that come with typical data provider relationships.

## Integration

If you're interested in this integration, reach out to your Braze Account or Customer Success Manager and ask them to consult Braze Data Strategy Services on Secure Data Sharing with Snowflake. This will get the cogs going inside Braze and we'll have your views set up in no time!

{% alert important %}
You must have an account with Snowflake to use the Data Sharing Services.

## Usage & Visualization

Similar to Currents, you can use your Secure Snowflake Data Sharing to...

-   Create complex reports,
-   Perform attribution modeling,
-   Secure sharing within your own company,
-   Map raw event or user data to a CRM (like Salesforce)...

And so much more!

After Braze sets up your views on Snowflake and grants you the access you need, we will send you some views. This data is similar to what you'd see in [Currents]({{ site.baseurl }}/partners/braze_currents/about/).  

You'll have access to historical, current, and future data dating from the beginning of when that data was sent to Snowflake up until you choose not to utilize Snowflake anymore.

You can do whatever you want with the data, but we recommend using it in conjunction with our Looker Blocks.

## Braze Benchmarks

Braze Benchmarks will allow Braze prospects and  customers alike to see how they compare to top players in their industry by comparing their metrics against Braze's industry benchmarks.

We created a [Data Tool for Braze Benchmarks](https://www.braze.com/perspectives/benchmarks) so you can view a selection of the data, outside the Snowflake interface.

The initial industries are: Delivery Services, Ecommerce, Education, Entertainment, Finance, Gaming, Health, Lifestyle, Restaurants, Retail, Technology, Transportation, and Travel.

Our benchmarking data will also be available directly in the Snowflake Data Exchange.
