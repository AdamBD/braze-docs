# Customer Feedback

_The Customer Feedback module has been deprecated and is not available to new integrations._

See [the Android integration instructions][1] for information on how to integrate the feedback form into your React Native Android app.

Note that the plugin method `launchFeedback` is not supported on Android.

See the [sample Android React application][2] or the [sample native Android application][3] for implementation samples.
