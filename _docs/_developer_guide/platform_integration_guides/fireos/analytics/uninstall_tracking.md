## Uninstall Tracking

Uninstall Tracking utilizes Firebase Cloud Messaging's "dry run" feature to detect uninstalled devices without actually sending a push notification to the device. As such, there is no SDK or device-side work necessary for Android and FireOS. For more information, see our [Uninstall Tracking][6] page on Braze Docs.
