# Content Security Policy Headers

Content-Security-Policy provides added security by restricting how and where content can be loaded on your website.

{% alert important %}
This article is intended for developers working on websites that enforce CSP rules, and how to integrate with Braze. It is not intended as advice on how you should approach security.
{% endalert %}

## Nonce Attributes

If you use a `nonce` value in your `script-src` or `style-src` directives, pass that value to the `contentSecurityNonce` initialization option to propagate it to newly created scripts and styles generated by the SDK.

```javascript
import braze from "@braze/web-sdk";

braze.initialize(apiKey, {
  baseUrl: baseUrl,
  contentSecurityNonce: "YWJjMTIz", // assumes a "nonce-YWJjMTIz" CSP value
});
```

## Directives

### connect-src

- `connect-src https://sdk.iad-01.braze.com` - allows the SDK to communicate with Braze APIs
  - This should be the same endpoint set in the `baseUrl` initialization option, as found [here](https://www.braze.com/docs/user_guide/administrative/access_braze/sdk_endpoints/).

### script-src

- `script-src https://js.appboycdn.com` - required when using the CDN-hosted integration.
- `script-src 'unsafe-eval'` - required only when using the integration snippet which contains reference to `appboyQueue`
  - To avoid using this directive, integrate using NPM or reference the `appboy.min.js` library directly via `<script src="path/to/appboy.min.js"></script>` without the `appboyQueue` logic.

## Font Awesome

If you use Font Awesome icons within your dashboard campaigns, the following CSP directives are required:

- `style-src https://use.fontawesome.com`
- `style-src 'unsafe-inline'` or `style-src 'nonce-...'` are also required.
- `font-src https://use.fontawesome.com`

{% alert tip %}
Note: The use of Font Awesome can be disabled using the `doNotLoadFontAwesome: true` initialization option.
{% endalert %}
