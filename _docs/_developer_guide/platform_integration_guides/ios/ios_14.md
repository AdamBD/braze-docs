# iOS 14 SDK Upgrade Guide

This guide describes relevant changes introduced in iOS 14 and the required upgrade steps for your Braze iOS SDK integration.

For a complete list of the new features and changes announced this year at WWDC, see Apple's [iOS 14 Preview](https://www.apple.com/ios/ios-14-preview/).

## Braze SDK Compatibility

To test and build an app targeting iOS 14, we recommend integrating our Braze iOS Beta Release, which can be found [here][1] TODO!. This beta release for iOS 14 will be regularly updated based on changes to Apple's iOS 14 beta releases.

If you experience any issues or questions related to our iOS 14 compatibility or beta release, please open a new [Github Issue][2].
