# In-App Messaging

In-App Messages are great for creating unobtrusive calls to action, notifying people of new content in the News Feed and driving them toward it or communicating with users who have push turned off. They are also effective for other content that isn't time-sensitive enough to warrant a push notification, or permanent enough to warrant a News Feed item. You can find a detailed explanation of in-app message behavior in [Braze Academy][4].
