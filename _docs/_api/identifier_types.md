# Template IDs, Canvas IDs and Campaign IDs

> This article touches on the different types of IDs that can be found within the Braze Dashboard, their purpose, where you can find them, and how to implement them yourself.

The following identifiers can be used to acess your teample, canvas or campaign from Braze's external API

## Template IDs

A Template ID, or Template API Identifier is a key generated by Braze for a given template within the Dashboard. Template IDs are unique for each template and can be used to reference templates throughout the platform. 

Templates are great for if your company contracts out your HTML designs for campaigns. Once the templates have been built, you now have a template that is not specific to a campaign, but can be applied to a series of campaigns like a newsletter.

### Where can I find it?
You can find your Template ID by going to the Dashboard, opening up "Templates & Media" under "Engagement" and selecting a pre-existing template. If the template you want does not exist yet, create one and save it. At the bottom of the individual template page, you will be able to find your Template API Identifier.
