# Dashboard Identifier Types

> This article touches on the different types of IDs that can be found within the Braze Dashboard, their purpose, where you can find them, and how to implement them yourself.

The following identifiers can be used to access your template, canvas or campaign from Braze's external API.

## Template IDs

A Template ID or Template API Identifier is a key generated by Braze for a given template within the Dashboard. Template IDs are unique for each template and can be used to reference templates throughout the platform. 

Templates are great for if your company contracts out your HTML designs for campaigns. Once the templates have been built, you now have a template that is not specific to a campaign but can be applied to a series of campaigns like a newsletter.

### Where can I find it?
You can find your Template ID one of two ways:

1. In the Dashboard, open up "Templates & Media" under "Engagement" and select a pre-existing template. If the template you want does not exist yet, create one and save it. At the bottom of the individual template page, you will be able to find your Template API Identifier.<br><br>
2. Braze offers an "Additional API Identifiers" search, here you can quickly look up specific identifiers. It can be found at the bottom of the "API settings" within the "Developer Console" page.
