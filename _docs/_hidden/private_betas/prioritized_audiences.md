# Prioritized Audiences

> Prioritized audiences can be used to assign priority to different user group or audiences. While this functionality was capable with Canvas through a workaround, Braze has built out a new, dedicated, and intuitive option for users. 

Prioritized Audiences allow you to:
- Send users down different paths based on audience criteria
- Users can have a total of 8 audience groups (2 default groups and 6 additional).

## Old Behavior
To achieve this with Full Steps, marketers would connect several Full Steps to one node and set different Audience criteria for each Full Step. When users reach this stage, they are evaluated for every Full Step. If a user qualifies for more than one Full Step, the system randomly chooses one. 	

## Create a Audience Path

To create a Audience Path, add a step to your Canvas. Then, use the drop-down at the top of a new step to select `Audience Paths`.

In the default Audience Step, there will already be two audience groups, __Group 1__ and __Everybody Else__. The Everybody else group is required and serves as a back up bucket that users who did not fall into any of the previous categories would fall in.

### Audience Path Explanation

Audience Paths should be seen as a sorting funnel with ranked criteria. Users are evaluated for each criteria in priority order, so there is no ambiguity as to where users will go. Users will always be sent down the path of the highest ranking criteria for which they qualify. Auidence Paths allow you to create up to 8 audience groups per step, though marketers may want to connect multiple Audience Path steps together to further sort their users.
