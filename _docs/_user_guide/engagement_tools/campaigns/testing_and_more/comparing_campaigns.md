Get started by visiting the Campaigns page in the Dashboard. From there, click the "Compare" button in the top right of the campaign grid.

As you select campaigns to compare, you'll notice the "Campaigns to Compare" table begin to populate with the selected campaigns.

Once you've selected at least two campaigns (and up to 10), click the "Compare Selected" button. The comparison table will open in a new tab on the Dashboard.

![Compare Selected Button][4]

Here you will see a table with each campaign listed, with the high-level campaign metrics for each campaign. To drill down into each campaign, click the campaign name to open the details page.
