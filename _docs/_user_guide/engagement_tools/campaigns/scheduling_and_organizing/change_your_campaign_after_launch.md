# Changing Your Campaign After Launch

If you need to make changes to a campaign post-launch, please take note of the items below when editing your campaign to ensure your changes have the desired effects.

## Message Content

Any message content changes (including titles, bodies, images, etc.) take effect immediately on saving for all message sends going forward. It is not possible to change the contents of messages that have already been dispatched.

## Scheduling and Audience

If you edit your campaign's scheduled send time, or its audience, those changes won't be reflected in the actual campaign until __after the end of the current 24 hour period__.

## Send Rate

Changes to message send rate limits go into effect __at the beginning of hour in the next time zone__ in which Braze has scheduled deliveries for the campaign.
