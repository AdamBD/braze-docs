user_top_text: "Push Messages, Emails, and In-App messages are wonderful but ephemeral content. Once swiped away, you lose your opportunity to engage. If you catch a user at the wrong time, that message is lost to them forever. Multi-Channel messaging helps to ameliorate this problem, but the News Feed really puts it to rest once and for all."
