# About Locations and Geofences

Geofences are only available in select Braze packages. For access please create a support ticket or speak with your Braze Customer Success Manager.

The ubiquity and flexibility of mobile technology allows marketers, product managers and growth teams to reach their users everywhere, blurring the lines between digital and real-world experiences. Using the Braze platform, you can create and enhance relationships with your users based upon their location in the real world, unlocking a powerful set of deeply connected interactions:

- Upload the locations of all of your brands' brick and mortar stores, and send push notifications to loyal users notifying them of in-store promotions if they pass nearby.
- Upload the location of an upcoming concert, and message users letting them know where to register when they reach the venue. Then, follow up with a thank you message an hour after they depart.

At the core of Braze's real-time location offering is the concept of a "geofence." A geofence is a virtual geographic area, represented as latitude/longitude pairs combined with a radius, forming a circle in a specific position on the globe. Geofences can vary in size from the size of a building to the size of an entire city.

You can define geofences on the Braze Dashboard and trigger campaigns in real-time as users enter and exit them across the globe. Geofences are deeply integrated into Braze's segmentation and messaging capabilities. Campaigns can be delivered in real-time to users as they exit or enter geofences, or sent as followups hours or days later. As users enter or exit your geofences, Braze's location analytics also add a new layer of user data that can be used for segmentation and re-targeting. Geofence-specific analytics also generate insight on the activity of particular locations of interest.

# Geofences Overview

Geofences are managed in the Locations page in the Engagement section. Geofences are organized into geofence sets - a group of geofences that can be used to segment or engage users throughout the platform. Example geofence sets include `All Northeast Regional Stores` or `September Events`. A given geofence set may only contain up to 10,000 geofences.
