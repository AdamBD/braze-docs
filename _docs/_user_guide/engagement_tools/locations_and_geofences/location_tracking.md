# Location Tracking

Location collection captures a user's most recent location when the app was opened using GPS location data. You can use this information to [segment data based on users who were in a defined location][1]. 

## Enabling Location Tracking

To enable location collection on your app, take a look at the appropriate developer guide for the platform you are using:

- [iOS][2]
- [Android][3]
- [Web][4]

In general, mobile apps will use the device's GPS chip and other systems (such as Wi-Fi scanning) to track a user's location. Web apps will use WPS (Wi-Fi Positioning System) to track a user's locations.
