# Adding Users

Go to the __Manage Users__ page under your username and click the __Add New User__ button. Then, enter their information (including email) as prompted.

![Add New User1][27]

![Add New User2][28]

There is no limit on the number of users (either administrators or limited users) you can have on your company account. However, if there is only one admin left in your app group, that individual will not be able to remove their own admin permission.
