# About

Most features within Company Settings are only available to Braze account administrators. If you don't have access but feel that you should, reach out to your company's Braze account administrator. If you're looking for more information about your own account settings, look [here][1].


You can get to the Company Settings section by clicking on your name, then clicking Company Settings in the dropdown.

Then, click on the tab in the top bar to navigate to the settings you want to manage.
