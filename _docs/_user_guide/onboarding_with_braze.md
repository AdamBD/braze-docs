# Welcome to Braze!

We’re happy you’re here! This section will help you and your developers/engineers get set up and ready to use Braze to create strong, lasting bonds between you and your customers! By now, you should have had some sort of kick-off communication with teams at Braze.

This guide is tailored to both supplement fully-guided onboarding, as well as advise on onboarding actions you can take on your own. By the end of your onboarding, you should feel comfortable with:

1. Braze terminology,
2. Working with your engineers to integrate Braze,
3. Using Braze as a tool to launch your campaigns, and
4. Setting up and preparing to use email with Braze.


You can follow along with this guide, or you can check out [LAB](https://lab.braze.com)! We have courses for you, as well as a [Technical Integration Toolkit](http://lab.braze.com/technical-integration-checklists-and-toolkits) and [Technical Integration Overview](http://lab.braze.com/quick-overview-technical-integration) available for your developers!

Continue to the next part of the guide, [Terms to Know]({{ site.baseurl }}/user_guide/onboarding_with_braze/terms_to_know/), to familiarize yourself with some common words you'll see in Documentation, the product, and from the people of Braze.
