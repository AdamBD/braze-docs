# Full-Screen In-App Messages

Full-Screen messages take up the whole screen of the device! This message type is great when you really need your user's attention, like for mandatory app updates.

## Image and Copy Behavior

Full-screen in-app messages are designed to fill the entire height of a device. This can sometimes result in the cropping of the left and right sides of an image, so be aware and give yourself some extra space on the sides of your image or gif content. This may mean adding a few extra pixels in a main background color on each side of your image.
