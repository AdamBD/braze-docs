# Slideup In-App Messages

Our Slideups typically appear at the top or bottom of the app screen (you can set this when you create your message). These are great for alerting your users about new terms of service, cookies, and other snippets of information.

| Slideup Size | 450px Maximum Width | 3-Line maximum height, at which point the message is truncated with an ellipsis. |
| Image/Icon Size | 50px by 50px | These images are optional, but always appear on the left side of the message. |
| Copy | 14px - Bolded | Three lines of text will appear before being truncated with an ellipsis. |

### Slideup Viewport

On a tablet or desktop browser, a slideup in-app message will sit in the corner of the app screen as shown below (unless designated otherwise when creating the in-app message).
