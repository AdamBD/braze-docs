# Push Registration

> Understanding Push Tokens and what they are is a fundamental piece of understanding how we send Push Tokens here at Braze. A Push Token is an identifier that senders use to target specific devices with a push notification. If a device does not have a push token, there is no way to send push to it. This article covers the process through which a user gets assigned a push token, and how Braze sends Push messages to your users. 

Push Tokens are generated by Push Service Providers. Braze Push Service Providers include Firebase Cloud Messaging Service (FCMs) for Android and Apple Push Notification Service (APNs) for iOS. Each device has one, unique token that is used for messaging. Tokens can expire or be updated.

Android and iOS deal with Push token registration in different ways:
- __Android__: Receives a token as soon as a user downloads and opens an application. Automatically registering users for Push Notifications.
- __iOS__: Not automatically registered. 
    - __iOS 12__: If you have [provisional authorization]({{ site.baseurl }}/user_guide/message_building_by_channel/push/ios/notification_options/#provisional-push-authentication--quiet-notifications) set up, you will be allowed to send notifications silently to the notification center of the device. These notifications may prompt users to decide to continue to receive notifications. Their push subscription state is dependent on the user's response to this prompt. 
    - __iOS 11 and Later & iOS 12 (without Provisional Authorization)__: <br>The native Push notification prompt appears for new users to an application. Users respond to this prompt by selecting allow or deny. __Deny__ denies push token registration, therefore denying push notifications to your phone from that application. __Allow__ registers and creates a new push token, then and there.

| Get a Push Token | Send a Push Token |
| ---------------- | ----------------- |
| Applications must register with a push provider in order to get a push token for a device. | Developers can then target the device using the push token generated by FCM/APNs.|

### Three ways to Check a Users Push Registration State:
1. __User Profile__: Individual user profiles can be accessed through the Braze dashboard by selecting User Search from the right sidebar. Here, you can look up user profiles by email address, phone number, or external user ID. Once in a user profile, under the Engagement tab, you can view a user's push registration state. <br><br>
2. __CSV Export__: User profiles can be accessed through doing a CSV User Data Export. This can be done by selecting a campaign and then selecting User Data in the upper right corner. In the window that pops up, you may select what custom attributes or events you would like to choose. <br><br>
3. __Rest API Export__: Individual user profiles can be exported in the JSON format using the users/export/ [segment][segment] or [identifier][identifier] endpoints by using Brazeâ€™s REST API. Braze will return a push tokens object, that contains push enablement information per device, as well as an additional `notifications_enabled` parameter that will signify if a user blocked notifications from displaying (the [previous Android SDK][1] version does not have the `notifications_enabled` parameter).


### What Does this Look Like on a Broader Scale?

When a user opens a new application, if push has been configured correctly, a call is made from the Braze SDK to the Push Providers. When that call is made, the Push Provider runs a check to see if everything is set up correctly. If so, a push token gets passed into your device. When that token arrives, the SDK communicates this to Braze. Once Braze has received the token from the Push Provider, we update or create a new user profile. These users are now considered Registered.

If we want to launch a campaign, we create a campaign in Braze that generates a push payload to send to the Push Provider. From there, the Provider delivers the Push Payload to the user's device and the SDK passes the messaging state to Braze.
