# iOS 15 push notification design guide

> This reference article covers guidelines and recommendations to consider while designing push messages for iOS 15 and above.

While we can't provide a hard and fast rule for the precise number of characters to include in a push, we have some great guidelines and recommendations for you to consider while designing iOS messages. When in doubt, keep it short and sweet. Play it safe, targeting about 30â€“40 characters per line for both the message title and body.

## Notification states

Your users may view push notifications in a variety of different situations, and could see different lengths of text as follows.

<table>
<thead>
  <tr>
    <th>Lock screen or Notification Center</th>
    <th>Expanded</th>
    <th>Device active</th>
  </tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
  <tr>
    <td width="33%">This is the most common scenario.<br><br><b>Title:</b> 1 line of text<br><b>Body:</b> 4 lines of text<br><b>Image:</b> square thumbnail</td>
    <td width="33%">When a user long-presses a message.<br><br><b>Title:</b> 1 line of text<br><b>Body:</b> 7 lines of text<br><b>Image:</b> 2:1 aspect ratio (recommended, see note below)</td>
    <td width="33%">When a user receives a push while their phone is unlocked and active.<br><br><b>Title:</b> 1 line of text<br><b>Body:</b> 2 lines of text</td>
  </tr>
</tbody>
</table>
{: .reset-td-br-1 .reset-td-br-2 .reset-td-br-3 }

![alt text][1]

{% alert note %}
While we recommend a 2:1 aspect ratio for expanded push notifications, nearly any aspect ratio is supported. Images will always span the full width of the notification, and the height will adjust accordingly.
{% endalert %}

## Variables in text truncation

When creating content, consider the following scenarios that may impact how much text is displayed.

{% tabs %}
{% tab Timing %}

### Timing

Depending on when a user engages with a push notification, the timestamp can shorten the title text.

![Example push notification with a timestamp of "now" and title character count of 35]({% image_buster/assets/img_archive/push_ios_timing_35.png %})
<br>Title character count: **35**

![Example push notification with a timestamp of "3h ago" and title character count of 33]({% image_buster/assets/img_archive/push_ios_timing_33.png %})
<br>Title character count: **33**

![Example push notification with a timestamp of "Yesterday, 8:37 AM" and title character count of 22]({% image_buster/assets/img_archive/push_ios_timing_22.png %})
<br>Title character count: **22**

{% endtab %}
{% tab Images %}

### Images

Body text is shortened by about 10 characters per line when an image is present.

![Example push notification with no image and a body character count of 179]({% image_buster/assets/img_archive/push_ios_images_179.png %})
<br>Body character count: **179**

![Example push notification with an image and a body character count of 154]({% image_buster/assets/img_archive/push_ios_images_154.png %})
<br>Body character count: **154**

{% endtab %}
{% tab Interruption level %}

### Interruption level

Time Sensitive and Critical denotations push the title down to a new line without the timestamp, giving it a little more space.

![Example push notification with no Time Sensitive or Critical denotation and a title character count of 35]({% image_buster/assets/img_archive/push_ios_interruption_level_35.png %})
<br>Title character count: **35**

![Example push notification with a Time Sensitive denotation and a title character count of 39]({% image_buster/assets/img_archive/push_ios_interruption_level_39.png %})
<br>Title character count: **39**

{% endtab %}
{% tab More %}

### And more

The following also impact text truncation:

- **Phone display settings:** a user can increase or decrease the global UI font size on their phone, typically for accessibility reasons.
- **Device width:** the message could be displayed on a small phone, or a wide iPad.
- **Content types:** emojis and wide characters like "m" and "w" take up more space than "i" or "t", and longer words like "engagement" may line-wrap more abruptly than shorter words.
