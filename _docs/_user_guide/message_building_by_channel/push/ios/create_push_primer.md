# Create a Push Primer Campaign

> This article will walk you through setting up and sending a Push Primer campaign to new or non-push enabled users. <br><br> Push Primer campaigns encourage your users to enable push on their device for your app. Getting permission from users to send messages directly to their device can be complex, but our guides can help!

For a user to qualify to receive your Push Messages, they must enable Push at the app-level _and_ the device-level. Please note that these levels translate differently for iOS and Android. You can learn more about them here:
- [Android Push Enabled]({{ site.baseurl }}/)
- [iOS Push Enabled]({{ site.baseurl }}/)

Push primer campaigns are important because IOS users only get asked for to have push notifications turned on once when they have the app downloaded. This usually only happens once, with the users Often disregarding this message and be opted out of push messages forever. (or until they go into settings, and manually turn on push notifications). Setting up an effective push primer early into you adoption of Braze is important if you want to use the push channel seriously. Setting up a push primer delays this initial push ask, allowing you to choose the message, time and formt in which you'd like to prime these users, providing them valuable information on why notifications are important. (see examples below)


## Step 1: Select you Channel of Choice

From the Campaigns pane within the Dashboard, select In-App Messaging under Create Campaign as the messaging channel.

## Step 2: Set Up Initial Campaign Options

Once you have a blank In-App Messaging campaign to work on, you must name your campaign, select where you would like your Push Primer campaign to send to, select the message type, and pick the layout type (text and image or image only). For your basic Push Primer campaign message type, we suggest either a full screen or modal message. 

## Step 3a: Customize your Message

After you have chosen how you want your push primer to look, you can customize your message and add buttons.

Remember that a push primer is supposed to prime the user to turn on push notifications. In your message body, include the reason they should have push notifications turned on. 

Here are some example Push Primer Messages:

Example 1, Example 2, Example, 3

To Add buttons, you will find a Button1 text box and Button2 text box. Here you can choose the text that will show on these buttons. We recommend "Turn on Notifications" and "close" as starter buttons, but there are many different button prompts you could assign. As noted below, we will be assigning these buttons to certain actions. 

If you would like even further customization options, you can also set the message type to Custom code, and provide the HTML .
