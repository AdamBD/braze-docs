# Push reporting

> This article covers push reporting, which you can use to view and analyze the success of your push campaigns.

Once you've launched your campaign or Canvas, you can return to the details page for that campaign or Canvas to view key metrics:

- **Campaigns:** Navigate to the **Campaigns** page and select your campaign to open the details page.
- **Canvas:** Navigate to the **Canvas** page and select your Canvas. Locate the step you want to view metrics for, and select that step to open the details page for that step.
