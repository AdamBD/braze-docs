# SMS Retargeting

In addition to changing the userâ€™s subscription state and sending auto-responders based on incoming keywords, Braze will also record interactions to the user profile for filtering and triggering messages. These filters and triggers allow you to filter users that have received SMS messages, received an SMS messages from a specific SMS campaign, and trigger messages as users receive an SMS messages from a specific SMS campaign.
