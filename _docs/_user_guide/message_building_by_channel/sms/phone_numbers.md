# Phone Numbers

This article will discuss different topics around your users' or customers' phone numbers - if you're looking for information about your own numbers, please go to our article on [Short & Long Codes]({{ site.basurl }}/onboarding_with_braze/sms_setup/short_and_long_codes/).


## Importing Phone Numbers

As a best practice, the best way to import a phone number is in E.164 format. This ensures that Braze does not have to do any 'guess' work to assign your number to a country. If that is not possible, we recommend the following.

All international numbers start with a '+' followed by the country code and then the phone number (e.g. +44 020 1234 1234)
All US numbers are valid 10 digit phone numbers (with a valid area code). They can be inputted without the '+' and country code. Braze will assume and map all valid 10 digit phone numbers to be considered US numbers.
Again, to ensure accuracy, it is recommended to use the E.164 format, even for USA based phone numbers.

Table:
Country Local phone number E.164 formatted number
USA 415 123 1234 +14151231234
UK 020 1234 1234 +442012341234
Lithuania 8 601 12345 +37060112345
