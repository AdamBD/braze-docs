# Email reporting

> This article covers the different components of your email reporting and where it can be found in the dashboard.

Once you've launched your campaign or Canvas, you can return to the details page for that campaign or Canvas to view key metrics:

- **Campaigns:** Navigate to the **Campaigns** page and select your campaign to open the details page.
- **Canvas:** Navigate to the **Canvas** page and select your Canvas. Locate the step you want to view metrics for, and select that step to open the details page for that step.
