## When to use email
Email messages are a great way to deliver rich content to your users. With email messaging, you can reach your users outside of your app or website.

## Advantages of using email

You can do a lot with email messages! Most notably, email messaging has unlimited felxibility for communicating with your users. You can even customize messages with the email editor and templates for later use in your campaigns or Canvases.

## Great use cases

Here are some great use cases to get you inspired!

- **Re-engagement:** Because email can reach users outside of your app, including those who have not installed the app, emails are well-suited for re-engagement.
- **Onboarding:** Email campaigns are also useful for onboarding new users and encouraging them to turn on push notifications or share the app via social networks.
- **Rich Messages:** For content that requires more than a simple push or slide, emails allow for rich and dynamic HTML messages.
- **Multimedia:** Using email allows for the placement of multimedia content like videos and images that engage users.
- **Newsletters:** Emails are convenient for sending monthly or weekly newsletters to maintain user engagement.
- **Transactions:** Transactional emails notify users of recent purchases and deliver important product and shipping information.
