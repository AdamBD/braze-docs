# Apple's Mail Privacy Protection

## What is Apple's Mail Privacy Protection Update?

Apple's Mail Privacy Protection (MPP) is a privacy update that will be available for users of the Apple Mail app on iOS 15, iPadOS 15, macOS Monterey, and watchOS 8, set to release mid-September 2021. For users who opt into MPP (which we predict most users will do), emails will now be preloaded using proxy servers, caching images, and hindering the ability to leverage tracking pixels for crucial metrics like open tracking. Once this feature goes into effect, brands should expect MPP to result in issues regarding email deliverability metrics and issues with pre-existing campaigns that trigger based on these metrics.

### Who will this Affect?

Any recipient using the native Apple Mail app on:
- iOS 15
- iPadOS 15
- macOS Monterey
- watchOS 8

This applies to all users who use the Apple Mail app to check mail on these operating systems, regardless of email service (Gmail, Outlook, Yahoo, AOL, etc.). This impact is not just constrained to subscribers who receive mail at Apple/iCloud/me.com email addresses.

While these updates to email deliverability are significant, MPP doesn't fundamentally change any of the rules that govern email and deliverability. Instead, it will impact how we benchmark success and what email tools and functionalities can be used going forward.

## How to Prepare for MPP? Next steps?

Time is of the essence for brands who are just beginning to think about how they respond to MPP and its potential impact on their email marketing and overall customer engagement efforts. We recommend users:
- Assess the risk that MPP poses to their marketing efforts
- Put together a targeted MPP response plan that addresses automation adjustments on the Braze platform, strengthens deliverability best practices, and develops a broader set of metrics to measure performance.
- Implement that response plan as soon as they can
