# What are Content Cards?

{% alert note %}
Braze recommends that customers who use our News Feed tool move over to our Content Cards messaging channel - it is more flexible, customizable, and reliable. It is also easier to find and use in the Braze product. See our [Migration Guide](/docs/user_guide/message_building_by_channel/content_cards/migrating_from_news_feed/) or contact your Braze account manager for more information.

## When to Use Content Cards 

{% include video.html id="4FUPxkIq2xc" align="right" %}

Content Cards typically sit in a feed of sorts (but not necessarily), and help you take advantage of the visual space by incorporating images and graphics that stand out. You can personalize the cards based on user actions, onboard your customers with a checklist, and much more!

### Great Use Cases

- Showcase new content.
- Coordinate with push messages to illustrate a persistent record of promotions.
- Give customers without push enabled access to promotions.
- Trigger order confirmations or other personalized communication with your customer.
- Develop and deliver and an onboarding schedule.

## Content Cards & Feed

This is what it looks like for your users to open a standard Content Card feed. As you can see, there are three standard types of cards that can sit in the feed - a Banner Card, a Captioned Content Card, and a Classic Content Card.
