## Reporting in Campaigns

Campaigns will deliver your reports in a series of blocks. You may see more or less than those listed in the tabs below, but each has their own useful purpose.

{% tabs %}

{% tab Campaign Details %}

__Campaign Details__

The Campaign Details analytics block will give you a high-level overview of the entire in-app message campaign.
