# Content Card reporting

> This reference article provides an overview of the different Content Card reporting metrics and analytics options provided in the Braze dashboard.

Once you've launched your campaign or Canvas, you can return to the details page for that campaign or Canvas to view key metrics:

- **Campaigns:** Navigate to the **Campaigns** page and select your campaign to open the details page.
- **Canvas:** Navigate to the **Canvas** page and select your Canvas. Locate the Content Card step you want to view metrics for, and select that step to open the details page for that step.

## Reporting breakdown

From the **Campaign Analytics** tab for campaigns or the **Details** page for Canvas steps, you can view your reports in a series of panels. You may see more or less than those listed in the tabs below, but each has its own useful purpose.

### Campaign or Canvas Step Details

The **Campaign Details** and **Canvas Step Details** panels show a high-level overview of the Content Card's entire performance. 

Review this panel to see overall metrics such as how many messages have been sent to how many recipients, the primary conversion rate, and the total revenue generated by this Content Card. You can also review your general settings from this page: Delivery Settings, Audience Settings, and Conversion Settings.

#### Control groups

To measure the impact of an individual Content Card, you can add a [Control Group][2] to an A/B Test. The **Campaign Details** panel doesn't include metrics from the Control Group variant.

{% alert warning %}
If you have a customized feed, be sure to log impressions for control cards to inform our analytics of when a user _would have seen_ the control card in its feed position. For more detail, see the [iOS](/docs/developer_guide/platform_integration_guides/ios/content_cards/data_model/#card-methods), [Android](/docs/developer_guide/platform_integration_guides/android/content_cards/customization/#fully-custom-content-card-display-for-android), and [Web](/docs/developer_guide/platform_integration_guides/web/content_cards/integration/#control-group) developer guides.
{% endalert %}

### Message Performance

The **Message Performance** panel outlines how well each variant of your message has performed across various dimensions. This includes, among others, your impressions, clicks, dismissals, revenue, and conversions. You can click on the <i class="fa fa-eye preview-icon"></i>**Preview** icon to view your message for each variant.

![CC_Message_Performance]({% image_buster /assets/img/cc-message-performance.png %})

For campaigns, if you want to simplify your view, click **+ Add/Remove Columns** and clear any metrics as desired. By default, all metrics are displayed.

#### Content Card metrics

Here is a breakdown of some key metrics you may see while reviewing your message performance. For the definitions of all Content Cards metrics, refer to the [Report Metrics Glossary][1] and filter by Content Cards.

| Term | Definition |
| -- | -- |
| Total Impressions | The total count of impressions logged for a given Content Card. This can increment multiple times for the same user. |
| Unique Impressions | The number of users who have viewed a given card. This count doesn't increment the second time that a user views a card. |
| Unique Recipients | The total number of viewers (unique, but only unique per day) that have viewed the particular card. Because a viewer can be a unique recippient every day, you should expect this to be higher than Unique Impressions. |
| Unique Clicks | The number of recipients who have clicked the CTA link of a Content Card at least once—excluding clicks on Braze-provided unsubscribe links. |
Unique Dismissals | The number of users who have dismissed Content Cards from a campaign. A user dismissing a Content Card from a campaign multiple times represents one unique dismissal. |

{% alert note %}
Regarding how impressions are logged, there are some nuances between web, Android, and iOS. Generally speaking, Braze logs an impression once a card is seen—when a user scrolls to the specific Content Card in their feed.

{% details More on Unique Recipients versus Unique Impressions %}

There are a few metrics available that cover the visibility of your message. This includes Messages Sent, Unique Recipients, and Unique Impressions. In particular, the difference between Unique Recipients and Unique Impressions can be a bit confusing. Let's use a few example scenarios to understand these metrics better.

Let's say you view a Content Card today, then view the same card tomorrow, and again the day after tomorrow—you will be counted as a Unique Recipient three times. However, you will only be counted for one Unique Impression. You'll also be included in the number of Messages Sent, as the card was available on your device.

As another example, suppose you see five Unique Impressions on a Content Card campaign showing 150,000 Messages Sent. This means the card was made available (on the backend) to an audience of 150,000 users, but only five users' devices performed all of the following steps after that send occurred:

1. Started a session or the app explicitly requested a Content Cards sync (or both)
2. Navigated to the Content Cards view
3. SDK recorded an impression and logged it to the server

Your Messages Sent refers to Content Cards available to be seen, while Unique Recipients refers to Content Cards that were actually seen.

{% enddetails %}

### Historical Performance

The **Historical Performance** panel allows you to view the metrics from the **Message Performance** panel as a graph over time. You can filter to compare specific metrics. To get a day-by-day breakdown, click **Download CSV** and receive a CSV export of the report.

### Conversion Event Details

The **Conversion Event Details** panel shows you the performance of your conversion events for an individual Content Card. For more information, refer to [Conversion Events]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/engagement_tools/campaigns/building_campaigns/conversion_events/#step-3-view-results).

### Conversion Correlation

The **Conversion Correlation** panel gives you insight into what user attributes and behaviors help or hurt the outcomes you set for campaigns. For more information, refer to [Conversion Correlation]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/engagement_tools/testing/conversion_correlation/).
