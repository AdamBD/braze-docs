## Contract Details 

Here, you’ll find information on when your current Braze contract starts and ends, as well as allotted data points and a sum of all data points that have been used thus far in your current contract.

## Current Billing Cycle - App Group Data Point Usage

Depending on whether you chose a time frame of weeks or months, your data here will be broken down by weeks or months. You’ll see how many data points were consumed for each time frame, and a color coded breakdown of which apps contributed to those data points. Using this graph, you can monitor your data point usage over different periods of time and check for trends as well as outliers, such as unexpected spikes during particular time frames.

## Data Point Usage Over Time

You can use this section to monitor how your data point usage is trending over time, and how close you are to hitting your contract’s allotment. One trend line shows your consumption, and the other shows your contract allotment.
